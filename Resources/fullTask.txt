1. Safety is job one. So, put your gloves on!
2. Label all your test tube. 
3. Next, we will need to add solutions to the test tubes. Select which pipette to use based on the volume you need to transfer.
4. After selecting the pipette, withdraw the liquid from the flask.
5. Transfer the liquid in the following sequence. ( NaCl -> Dye -> Protein )
6. Then, we will start to measure absorbance of each sample. We first need to adjust the spectometer to the correct wavelength. (595nm)
7. Put in Tube #1 (which has no protein) as blank and zero the reading by clicking on the button.
8. Next, measure absorbance of each sample by placing the test tube in the spectometer.
9. Record the absorbance of each sample in the table.
10. Calculate the protein in each tube in order to plot the standard curve.
11. Open graph through the pause menu and plot the graph.
12. Now we have the standard curve, let's measure protein concentration of unknown samples.
13. Repeats Step 1-9 but we only have two test tubes here: tube 1 for blank, and tube 2 for unknown.
14. After measuring the absorbance, the absorbance should show up as a red dot on the standard curve. Calculate unkown protein concentration using standard curve equation.
15. Calculate stock concentration of the unknown sample using C1V1 = C2V2.
16. You are done!
